# Woman - Wonderful Management
Web app with chatbot using ML to appropriately tag your writings, speech, and notes.
This is a combined effort of 4 female students, trying to code for real life applications of machine learning.

## Tech stack
1. Google Cloud Dialogflow - for chatbot API
2. Google Cloud Firebase - for database storage
3. Python - for backend service handling
4. React - for web application to visualise the graph using the data pulled out of database

## Requirements
Following libraries are required for this project:
1. ngrok - for server
2. flask - for app service
3. node - for react app
4. npm - for react app
5. pyrebase - for firebase database connection

## To start the server
Use the following command to run the server -
`ngrok http 5000`

## To run the flask app
Use the following command to run the flask app on a new terminal -
`python dialogflow.py flask run`

## Connections
The webhook url will be generated by ngrok which should be plugged into dialogflow to connect
the python application. All the intent requests are serviced by the flask application.
For http endpoints in react application for data retrieval, same flask service is used.
